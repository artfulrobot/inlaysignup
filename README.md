# inlaysignup

An embeddable sign up form for CiviCRM useing Inlay.

**This 'main' branch is not used.** This is because [InlayPetition](https://codeberg.org/artfulrobot/inlaypetition/) does a better job (despite its name) for most purposes.

However, **please see the "simplest" branch** which provides one of those annoying pop-up newsletter-signup forms that appear when you've been on a website for a while, as this *is* in active use.
